# Audio-Data-Processing-MFCC
In order to make the audio data processable, it is necessary to define the linguistic content and identify the components of the good audio signal.

MFCC features have been developed considering perceptual factors in the human ear. Attributes are also called feature vectors or feature vectors. Feature vectors representing the speaker have a very important place in speaker recognition applications such as voice biometrics, speech recognition and speech synthesis.

In order to describe the linguistic content, it is necessary to identify the components of the sound signal that are good. The main point to understand about speech is that the vocal tract is filtered according to its shape. The shape of the vocal tract manifests itself within the short-term power spectrum, and it is the job of MFCCs to accurately represent this envelope. The human ear is sensitive to the power spectrum of an audio signal. Therefore, when analyzing an audio signal, spectral analysis of the audio is often done for feature extraction.

Convert mp3 files to wav file to get properties.

# Data Visualization

In model training, data visualization can be applied to MFCC attributes to identify MFCCs that are parsers. Evaluation can be made according to the MFCC values where different colors represent the class attribute.

The data visualization process will be effective in the correct operation of the model.
